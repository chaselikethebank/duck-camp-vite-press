# Digital Ocean & MongoDB Costs

## MongoDB Costs
- **MongoDB Atlas** (cloud-based MongoDB service) offers a free tier with 512 MB storage, suitable for small applications.
- For moderate usage, a shared cluster with 2 GB storage and 1 GB RAM would cost around **$25-$30 per month**.

## Server Costs
For a small application, a shared or virtual private server (VPS) would suffice.
- Services like **DigitalOcean**, **AWS Lightsail**, or similar offer VPS plans starting at around **$5-$10 per month** for a basic configuration (1 CPU, 1 GB RAM, 30 GB SSD).
- For moderate usage, a **$10-$20 per month** plan should be sufficient.

### DigitalOcean Server Example
If your lower cost DigitalOcean server costs +/- **4 cents per hour**, here's the monthly cost calculation:
- **Hourly rate**: $0.04
- **Monthly cost**:  
  \[
  0.04 \text{ (cents/hour)} \times 24 \text{ (hours/day)} \times 30 \text{ (days/month)} = 28.80 \text{ dollars/month}
  \]

So, a server would cost approximately **$28.80 per month**. (this is what will spin up the apis for the app)

## Total Estimated Costs
- **MongoDB**: $25-$30 per month
- **Server**: $10-$20 per month
- **Total**: $35-$50 per month

- **Safe**: $100 per month cloud services 

## Additional Considerations
- **Bandwidth and data transfer costs**: Typically negligible for small applications, but may add up depending on usage.
- **Additional services** (e.g., email services, authentication services): Costs depend on the specific services used.

## Scaling and Future Costs
- As the user base grows, costs will increase. Be prepared to upgrade your MongoDB plan and server resources accordingly.
- Consider using **autoscaling** features to adjust resources based on demand.
- These estimates are rough and may vary depending on your specific use case. Monitor your usage and adjust your infrastructure accordingly to ensure optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.
