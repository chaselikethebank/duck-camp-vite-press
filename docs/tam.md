### Duck Camps:
- Let's assume there are approximately 2,500 duck camps in the US (based on our previous conversation).

### Outfitters (including duck camps, big game hunting camps, fishing camps, goose camps, etc.):
- Let's assume there are approximately 20,000 outfitters in the US (considering various types of outdoor guides and camps).

### Now, let's calculate the potential revenue:

#### Duck Camps:
- 5% of 2,500 duck camps = 125 camps
- Revenue: 125 camps * $50/month = $6,250/month
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $6,250/month * 12 = $75,000/year

#### Outfitters:
- 5% of 20,000 outfitters = 1,000 outfitters
- Revenue: 1,000 outfitters * $50/month = $50,000/month
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $50,000/month * 12 = $600,000/year
