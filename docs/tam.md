# TAM

## Starting Market

### Duck Camps:
- Let's assume there are approximately 2,500 duck camps in the US.

### Outfitters (including duck camps, big game hunting camps, fishing camps, goose camps, etc.):
- Let's assume there are approximately 20,000 outfitters in the US (considering various types of outdoor guides and camps).

### Now, let's calculate the potential revenue:

#### Duck Camps:
- 5% of 2,500 duck camps = 125 camps
- Revenue: 125 camps * $50/month = $6,250/month
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $6,250/month * 12 = $75,000/year

#### Outfitters:
- 5% of 20,000 outfitters = 1,000 outfitters
- Revenue: 1,000 outfitters * $50/month = $50,000/month
- Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR): $50,000/month * 12 = $600,000/year

### Breakdown of Outfitters:

- **500 Duck Camps**
    - **5000 Hunt Camps**
        - Deer and big game hunting camps
        - Fishing camps (freshwater and saltwater)
        - Waterfowl hunting camps (ducks, geese, etc.)
        - Wing-shooting and upland game bird hunting camps
        - Other specialty outfitters (elk, turkey, bear, etc.)
        - **Potential ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)**


## Closing the Sale

### Calculating Total ARR

#### Duck Camps:
- 125 duck camps generating $75,000 in annual revenue.

#### Outfitters:
- 1,000 outfitters generating $600,000 in annual revenue.

**Total Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)** = $75,000 (duck camps) + $600,000 (outfitters) = **$675,000/year**.

### Industry Multiples for Valuation

Private equity firms typically apply a revenue multiple to businesses with stable, recurring revenue streams. The multiple can vary based on the industry, growth rate, risk factors, and other elements such as the management team, customer retention, and scalability.

For businesses in the **outdoor recreation and services** space, particularly those that have recurring revenue (like subscription models for camps), the typical multiple might range from **3x to 6x** of ARR, depending on the specifics.

### Estimating the Business Value (Duck Camps)

- **Duck Camps ARR** = $75,000/year

- At a **3x multiple**:  
  Business value = **$75,000 * 3** = **$225,000**

- At a **6x multiple**:  
  Business value = **$75,000 * 6** = **$450,000**

---

### Estimating the Business Value (Outfitters)

- **Outfitters ARR** = $600,000/year

- At a **3x multiple**:  
  Business value = **$600,000 * 3** = **$1,800,000**

- At a **6x multiple**:  
  Business value = **$600,000 * 6** = **$3,600,000**

---

### Estimating the Business Value (Duck Camps)

- **Duck Camps ARR (seasonal adjustment)**:  
  Since hunting is seasonal, we will adjust the revenue to reflect only part of the year. Assuming a 6-month active season, we scale the annual revenue down by 50%.

  - **Adjusted ARR** = $75,000 * 50% = **$37,500/year**

- At a **3x multiple**:  
  Business value = **$37,500 * 3** = **$112,500**

- At a **6x multiple**:  
  Business value = **$37,500 * 6** = **$225,000**

---

### Estimating the Business Value (Outfitters)

- **Outfitters ARR (seasonal adjustment)**:  
  Similar to duck camps, outfitters also operate seasonally. Assuming a 6-month active season, the annual revenue is reduced by 50%.

  - **Adjusted ARR** = $600,000 * 50% = **$300,000/year**

- At a **3x multiple**:  
  Business value = **$300,000 * 3** = **$900,000**

- At a **6x multiple**:  
  Business value = **$300,000 * 6** = **$1,800,000**

---

### Considerations for the Multiple

The valuation could be higher or lower based on factors such as:
- **Growth potential**: Is there a clear path to expand the number of camps or outfitters in the future?
- **Profit margins**: What is the profitability of the business? A high-margin business would likely receive a higher multiple.
- **Customer retention**: How sticky is the service? Recurring revenue with high retention rates is more valuable.
- **Market conditions**: The overall investment climate and market demand for similar businesses also influence the multiple.

## Conclusion

Is this something worth pursuing? Upfront costs, server costs, marketing, branding, time, etc 

Where is the watershed of "this doesn't make sense" to "this makes sense"?
